## About This Repo
Welcome to the **Cursed Code** repository, a collection of _cursed_ Ruby code snippets submitted by the global Ruby community. The goal is to refactor these monstrosities on a YouTube channel, turning them into clean, maintainable code. 

## How to Read the Code Examples
All code examples are organised into their own directories. Each directory contains:
- A `before` directory with the original, cursed code.
- An `after` directory with the refactored version.

## How to Submit Some Cursed Code
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your own directory with a `before` subdirectory containing your cursed code.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to propose your submission.

## Rules of Submission
- You must have permission to share the code publicly.
- The code must be written in Ruby.
- Limit your example to a maximum of 5 files and 500 lines of code.
- The code must include tests that can be easily run.
- Ensure the code includes a `Gemfile` for dependency management.

## Voting for Content You Would Like to See
