## About This Repo
Welcome to the **Cursed Code** repository, a collection of _cursed_ Ruby code snippets submitted by the global Ruby community. 

The code examples here are submitted by the global Ruby community, with the aim of them being refactored as educational guides. 

## How to Read the Code Examples
All code examples are organised into their own directories. Each directory contains:
- A `before` directory with the original, cursed code.
- An `after` directory with the refactored version.

## How to Submit Some Cursed Code
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your own directory with a `before` subdirectory containing your cursed code.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to propose your submission.

## Rules of Submission
1. You must have permission to share the code publicly, and consent to your code being used and refactored in various media.
2. The code must be written in Ruby.
3. Limit your example to a maximum of 5 files and 500 lines of code.
4. The code must include tests that can be easily run (preferably with `rake`)
5. Ensure the code includes a `Gemfile` for dependency management.
